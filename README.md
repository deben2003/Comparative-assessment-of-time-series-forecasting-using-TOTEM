# Comparative Assessment of Time Series Forecasting using TOTEM

This repository contains the code, datasets, and results for the project **"Comparative Assessment of Time Series Forecasting using TOTEM"**, a Samsung PRISM research initiative. The project evaluates the performance of the TOTEM model (Tokenized Time Series Embeddings) across various business domains and forecasting horizons.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To analyze and compare the performance of the TOTEM model for:
- Different forecasting horizons
- Diverse business domain datasets
- The effect of tokenization vs traditional TSF approaches

## 📊 Use Cases
- Selecting an optimal foundational time series model
- Identifying the best forecasting horizon per dataset
- Evaluating the impact of tokenization in TS forecasting

## 🧠 Technologies & Skills Required
- Python (Google Colab)
- Deep Learning (Transformers, Foundation Models)
- Time Series Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
